## Backpropagation

The backpropagation algorithm was originally introduced in the 1970s, but its importance wasn't fully appreciated until a <a href='https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6088/pdf/323533a0.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>famous 1986 paper</a> by David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams. That paper describes several neural networks where backpropagation works far faster than earlier approaches to learning, making it possible to use neural nets to solve problems which had previously been insoluble. Today, the backpropagation algorithm is the workhorse of learning in neural networks.

Another definition about Backpropagation:

> "A common method of training a neural net in which the initial system output is compared to the desired output, and the system is adjusted until the difference between the two is minimized."
